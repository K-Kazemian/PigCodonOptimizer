# PigCodonOptimizer
PigCodonOptimizer is a Python program designed to convert a protein sequence into an mRNA sequence and an optimized DNA sequence for expression in pigs (Sus scrofa). The optimization uses the highest-frequency codons based on the pig codon usage table from GenScript's Codon Frequency Table, ensuring efficient gene expression in pig cells.
